                Hi my name is T.M. Carillo. It stands for Talmage Mark. I am 22 years old and I am a 
                senior transfer student at UC Berkeley studying Data Science. I started my college career
                in the summer of 2019 after graduating high school at Diablo Valley College in Pleasant Hill, Ca.
                I was originally a CS major but when I initially saw the math classes, I ended up switching into 
                accounting. I finished my AA in accounting and economics in 2021 but, I ended up taking more math classes
                and 2 CS classes for fun which reignited my interest in tech. I thought of staying another year at CC but,
                Berkeley introduced me to the Data Science major so after completing another AA in mathematics in 2022, I 
                ended up here.
                <h3 style="text-align: center;"><u>Before College</u></h3>
                <p class="section1">
                    I was born in Manila, Philippines in July 2001. My family moved to Singapore in 2004 and stayed there until
                    2006 where my family ended up moving again to Daly City, CA. We stayed there till 2008, and we moved for the final
                    time across to the east bay at Pittsburg, CA. Growing up my parents signed me up for a lot of things like boy scouts,
                    music lessons, and even tried to get me into sports(swimming and taekwando).None of those really stuck around in my life
                    except for music. I did concert band from middle school to high school. In May of 2019, I graduated De La Salle High school.
